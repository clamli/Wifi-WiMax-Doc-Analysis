proposes resolution for post LB232 comment on 802 11ah TXOP limits revisions rev initial version of the document rev modified proposal to allow support of packets sized for DHCP for example at low MCS rates but restrict TXOP limits for higher MCS rates discussion the original comment and current proposed change are below CID commenter pg ln section comment proposed change david goodall 1036/1 28 for 802 11ah non-sensor stas the default TXOP limit value for each AC is defined in table 9-146 this value is the same as the values for IEEE 802 11ac and is not suitable for the lower data rates of 802 11ah for example the TXOP limit for best effort traffic does not allow sufficient time for non-sensor STA to transmit either TCP packets or ping packets using MCS10 provide separate column in table 9-156 for clause 23 phys 802 11ah in which the TXOP limit for each AC is set to maximum of 15 008 milliseconds provide exceptions in section 10 24 for an S1G non-sensor STA that allow the TXOP holder to exceed the TXOP limit in the following cases transmission of an MSDU or MMPDU less than 600 octets transmission of fragment of an MSDU or MMPDU the fragment being less than 600 octets the proposed changes apply to clause 23 S1G non-sensor STA the exceptions allow smaller packets to be sent unfragmented at the lowest 802 11ah MCS rates for example DHCP packet may be sent without fragmentation at MCS0 or MCS10 in 1MHz channel it is preferred not to fragment DHCP packets because of the extra time required to obtain an IP address due to the backoff before accessing the medium plus each fragment requires preamble and is followed by SIFS and an NDP ACK 28 milliseconds additional fixed overhead per fragment at MCS10 the intent is that the new exceptions cover the case of whole MPDU for small packet and the case of fragment of an MPDU note that the case for retries potentially at lower MCS rate is covered in the existing exceptions in section 10 24 TXOP limits retransmission of an MPDU not in an A-MPDU consisting of more than one MPDU alternative approach another approach is to have different TXOP limit per group of mcss or PHY rates an S1G entry in table 9-156 could look like this for PHY rate 300 kbps 16 368 ms for PHY rate 300 kbps 32 736 ms potential downside of this approach is that devices may now use A-MPDU at lower MCS to aggregate short packets and fill up the entire 32 ms TXOP this is avoided with the exceptions approach TXOP limits for 802 11af clause 22 PHY the comment resolution document for the 802 11af TXOP limit appears to be this one https://mentor ieee org/802 11/dcn/12/11-12-1373-01-00af-tgaf-default-txop-limit docx the solution selected for 802 11af includes TXOP limit of for AC_BE which means that single packet can be transmitted in each TXOP this is not good solution for 802 11ah non-sensor stas as it would be impossible to send an A-MPDU containing multiple mpdus at higher MCS rates while single full size packet would take very long time at the lowest S1G PHY rate there is further discussion on TXOP limits here https://mentor ieee org/802 11/dcn/13/11-13-0014-01-000m-txop-limits pptx the 802 11ah PHY differs from the phys discussed in this document and supports rates down to 150 kbps MCS10 in mhz note that the smallest fragmentation threshold in 802 11 is 256 bytes in length and packet this size takes almost 15 milliseconds to transmit and receive an ACK using MCS10 in an 802 11ah 1MHz channel the use cases for 802 11ah do not preclude voice and video but spectrum is not necessarily available in all geographies for these types of applications in geographies where duty cycles are required these applications are more likely to be combined with sensor doorbell with low bit rate audio/video capability to help identify callers the exceptions recommended for resolving the 802 11ah TXOP limit issue support low rate audio/video from an outside gate at the edge of the BSS for example proposed

updated to address PAR change to frequency range R4 updated to address comments from 802 19 on CA document introduction this document addresses coexistence of IEEE 802 11ax per the PAR and CSD 6,3 the relevant sections of each are outlined below PAR scope this amendment defines operations in frequency bands between ghz and 125 ghz the new amendment shall enable backward compatibility and coexistence with legacy IEEE 802 11 devices operating in the same band CSD response to “Will the WG create CA document as part of the WG balloting process as described in clause 13 YES” band of operation though the PAR specifies the frequency range between ghz and 125 ghz 802 11ax is an enhancement to 802 11n in ghz and 802 11ac in ghz frequency bands and an extension into the ghz band ultra wideband systems under various standards cover wide frequency range here are some references to ITU-R spectrum management framework for UWB regulations SM 1756 and SM 1757 https://www itu

administrations when considering the introduction of devices using UWB technology and their impact on radiocommunication services that the following notes will be considered as part of this recommendation NOTE administrations authorizing or licensing devices using UWB technology should ensure pursuant to the provisions of the RR that these devices do not cause interference to and do not claim protection from or place constraints on the radiocommunication services of other administrations as defined in the RR and operating in accordance with those regulations NOTE upon receipt of notice of interference to the radiocommunication services referred to in note above from devices using UWB technology administrations should take immediate action(s to eliminate such interference SM

channel assessment CCA 802 11ax continues to use the 802 11ac CCA rules in ghz and the 802 11n CCA rules in ghz according to 802 11ac 21 18 PHY must set its CCA indication to busy as follows “Any signal within the primary 20 mhz channel at or above 62 dBm “Any signal within the secondary 20 mhz channel at or above 62 dBm “Any signal within the secondary 40 mhz channel at or above 59 dBm “Any signal within the secondary 80 mhz channel at or above 56 dBm the first two bullets above are the same as 802 11n the conditions for secondary 40 mhz channel and secondary 80 mhz channel are new to 11ac with the introduction of 80 mhz and 160 mhz channels respectively since the power spectral density is the same for each case the CCA performance will be comparable for the various bandwidths for ghz we refer to 19 19 which corresponds to 802 11n which corresponds to the same rules for 20 and 40 mhz described in the paragraph above coexistence with legacy 802 11 systems 802 11ax continues to use the non-HT short training field non-HT long training field and non-HT signal field as the initial fields in all new 802 11ax ppdus for coexistence with legacy 802 11 systems as was implemented in mixed-format 802 11n and 802 11ac ppdus therefore phy-level coexistence with legacy devices will be similar as was in 802 11n and 802 11ac new features the following features may affect 802 11ax coverage area and transmitted energy in the environment uplink multi-user operation spatial reuse extended range operation new OFDM waveform design preamble puncturing uplink multi-user operation while 802 11n added multi antenna transmission with MIMO and 802 11ac added downlink multi-user MIMO the total EIRP transmitted by device was limited by both regulatory restrictions and device costs resulting in energy on the air similar to 802 11g/a devices with 802 11ax uplink multi-user operation multiple client devices will transmit simultaneously to the AP during an uplink transmission with uplink OFDMA and 80 mhz up to 37 client devices could be transmitting simultaneously furthermore with uplink OFDMA an individual client device could transmit on resource unit as narrow as mhz resulting in substantially higher power spectral density depending on the regulatory limits with uplink MU-MIMO up to client devices could be transmitting simultaneously the aggregate energy on the air during an uplink multi-user transmission will be the sum of all the client devices and could be much higher than in 802 11n/ac spatial reuse 802 11ax introduces the concept of spatial reuse SR to increase capacity in dense environment by increasing frequency reuse between bss’s two SR operations have been specified as follows the first type of SR allows device to increase its “OBSS_PD threshold” in conjunction with decreasing its transmit power in 802 11n/ac the signal detect level of valid 802 11 signal is 82 dBm in 20 mhz this SR rule allows for an OBSS signal detect level up to 62 dBm of valid OBSS 802 11ax signals depending on the corresponding decrease in transmit power of the device the second rule employs more dynamic approach by which device examines new SR information in the 802 11ax preamble on packet by packet basis the new SR information in the preamble provides parameter that allows third party device to determine whether it would be possible to initiate an SR transmission during subsequent uplink multi-user transmission the important aspect of SR with respect to coexistence is that with 802 11ax SR techniques there may be more simultaneous transmissions on the air which may increase the overall interference floor extended range operation 802 11ax introduces new PPDU format with more robust preamble to address outdoor extended range environments the short and long training fields are boosted by dB and the signal fields are repeated twice for the data field of the PPDU both dual carrier modulation and narrower transmission bandwidth can both be used for diversity gain and noise bandwidth reduction respectively these modifications can expand 802 11ax BSS coverage area relative to 802 11n/ac which may affect coexistence with neighboring systems that said in ghz BSS employing the mbps 802 11 waveform with long preamble would have comparable coverage area new OFDM waveform design in 802 11n in ghz and 802 11n/ac in ghz the 20 mhz channelization uses 64pt FFT with edge tones at 28 in 802 11ax in both and ghz the 20 mhz channelization uses 256pt FFT with edge tones at 122 more spectrum is occupied within the channel bandwidth with the new 802 11ax OFDM waveform design that said due to the narrower subcarrier spacing 312 kHz for 802 11n/ac vs 78 125 kHz for 802 11ax the spectral rolloff for 802 11ax will be sharper and will result is less out-of-band emissions beyond 11 mhz see figure below preamble puncturing in downlink multi-user transmission an AP may choose to not populate certain sub-channels of its 80 or 160 mhz channel bandwidth if it finds the sub-channels busy in the HE-STF HE-LFT and data field that are transmitted in HE format this is performed by only assigning the free sub-channels to users the L-STF L-LTF L-SIG RL-SIG and HE-SIG-B preamble fields are transmitted in legacy mode and utilize the technique termed preamble puncturing to not transmit preamble fields in the corresponding 20 mhz sub-channels with respect to coexistence the spectral “holes” created by preamble puncturing are not protected by TX spectral mask the TX spectral mask only applies to the entire 80 or 160 mhz channel bandwidth therefore other systems in these sub-channels could see higher out-of-band emissions than that experienced by two neighboring systems where the out-of-band transmissions by each system are

wentink qualcomm utrecht the netherlands 31-65-183-6231 mwentink qualcomm com abstract this document proposes resolution for CID 1505 comment CID 1505 mark rison 10 there are several issues with the QS]SRC/LRC stuff sometimes it's per-MPDU 1290 in mc/D6 sometimes it's per-MSDU/MMPDU 1295 sometimes it's data frames only 1290 sometimes management too 1295 frankly can't work it out tell me whether SRC/LRC is per-MPDU or per-MSDU/MMPDU and whether it includes managament frames/MMPDUs and i'll come up with the changes discussion EDCA the current EDCA text related to retry counters is cited below dissected and reordered retry counters and the associated rules are marked bold 10 23 12 retransmit procedures 10 23 12 general qos STA shall maintain short retry counter and long retry counter for each MSDU A-MSDU or MMPDU that belongs to TC that requires acknowledgment the initial value for the short and long retry counters shall be qos stas also maintain short retry counter and long retry counter for each AC they are defined as QSRC[AC and QLRC[AC respectively and each is initialized to value of the following are the rules for the short retry count and QSRC the short retry count for an MSDU or A-MSDU that is not part of block ack agreement or for an MMPDU shall be incremented every time transmission of frame in PSDU of length less than or equal to dot11RTSThreshold fails for that MSDU A-MSDU or MMPDU after an RTS frame is transmitted to protect an MSDU or MMPDU qos STA performs the CTS procedure as defined in 10 CTS and DMG CTS procedure if valid CTS frame is received the QSRC[AC for the corresponding AC shall be reset to this short retry count and the qos STA QSRC[AC shall be reset when an A-MPDU or frame of length in PSDU less than or equal to dot11RTSThreshold succeeds if valid CTS frame is not received the short retry counter for the MSDU or MMPDU and the QSRC[AC for the corresponding AC shall be incremented QSRC[AC shall be incremented every time transmission of frame in PSDU of length less than or equal to dot11RTSThreshold fails regardless of the presence or value of the DEI field for internal collisions occurring with the EDCA access method the appropriate retry counters short retry counter for MSDU A-MSDU or MMPDU and QSRC[AC or long retry counter for MSDU A-MSDU or MMPDU and QLRC[AC are incremented the following are the rules for the long retry count and QLRC the long retry count for an MSDU or A-MSDU that is not part of block ack agreement or for an MMPDU shall be incremented every time transmission of MAC frame in PSDU of length greater than dot11RTSThreshold fails for that MSDU A-MSDU or MMPDU this long retry count and the QLRC[AC shall be reset when an A-MPDU or frame in PSDU of length greater than dot11RTSThreshold succeeds QLRC[AC shall be incremented every time transmission of an A-MPDU or frame in PSDU of length greater than dot11RTSThreshold fails regardless of the presence or value of the DEI field for internal collisions occurring with the EDCA access method the appropriate retry counters short retry counter for MSDU A-MSDU or MMPDU and QSRC[AC or long retry counter for MSDU A-MSDU or MMPDU and QLRC[AC are incremented 10 23 EDCA backoff procedure if the backoff procedure is invoked for reason or above or the transmission failure of non-initial frame by the TXOP holder the value of CW[AC shall be updated as follows before invoking the backoff procedure if the QSRC[AC or the QLRC[AC has reached dot11ShortRetryLimit or dot11LongRetryLimit respectively CW[AC shall be reset to cwmin[ac otherwise if CW[AC is less than cwmax[ac CW[AC shall be set to the value CW[AC else CW[AC shall be set to cwmax[ac 10 23 12 retransmit procedures 10 23 12 general retries for failed transmission attempts shall continue until one or more of the following conditions occurs the short retry count for the MSDU A-MSDU or MMPDU is equal to dot11ShortRetryLimit the long retry count for the MSDU A-MSDU or MMPDU is equal to dot11LongRetryLimit when any of these limits is reached retry attempts shall cease and the MSDU A-MSDU or MMPDU shall be discarded some observations on these rules the short retry count is updated for short packets like short msdus and RTS the long retry count is updated for long packets which are msdus longer than dot11RTSThreshold STA maintains retry counts per packet short retry count long retry count and for the STA overall QSRC/QLRQ for long packet rtss are transmitted until CTS is received the short retry count and QSRC are updated during that process when CTS is received but the long packet fails the long retry count and QLRC are updated therefore the long retry count and QLRC increase only when an RTS/CTS exchange already succeeded and collision was therefore not detected so it seems strange that the long retry count QLRC ties into the backoff procedure for resetting the CW the failing of the long MPDU itself may have more to do with MCS selection there appears to be little use for having two retry counters also the has reached language in 10 23 EDCA backoff procedure suggests that the CW keeps resetting once retry count is equal to or larger than its limit in an alternative interpretation has reached means is equal to in which case the CW resets only once this is kind of unclear and probably neither behavior was the intended one if the QSRC[AC or the QLRC[AC has reached dot11ShortRetryLimit or dot11LongRetryLimit respectively CW[AC shall be reset to cwmin[ac the station counters QSRC and QLRC reset only after succesful transmission not after packet discard so while packets are being discarded QSRC and QLRC keep counting there does not appear to be another reset of the QSRC and the QLRC except for successful transmission possible way forward might be to replace the dual retry counter structure with single backoff stage that governs the CW and single retry count that governs packet discard legacy implementations with the dual retry counter structure are assumed to be still be compliant under these simplified rules also because the retry limits are configurable by STA and an AP so there is not one single behavior described by the current rules 10 24 EDCA backoff procedure if the backoff procedure is invoked for reason or above the value of CW[AC shall be updated as follows before invoking the backoff procedure associated with each AC are backoff stage BS[AC which controls the size of CW[AC configurable maximum backoff stage bsmax[ac which shall be larger than 12 for each AC omitting AC for each parameter if BS is less than bsmax BS shall be increased by CW shall be set to the lesser of cwmax and 2^BS cwmin else BS equals bsmax BS shall be set to CW shall be set to cwmin any text related to QSRC and QLRC is deleted deletions not shown here single retry count remains which determines when packet must be discarded qos STA shall maintain retry counter for each MSDU A-MSDU or MMPDU that belongs to TC that requires acknowledgment the initial value for the retry counter shall be the retry count for an MSDU or A-MSDU that is not part of block ack agreement or for an MMPDU shall be incremented every time transmission fails for that MSDU A-MSDU or MMPDU including of an associated RTS retries for failed transmission attempts shall continue until one or more of the following conditions occurs the retry count for the MSDU A-MSDU or MMPDU is equal to dot11RetryLimit when this limit is reached retry attempts shall cease and the MSDU A-MSDU or MMPDU shall be

invoked for reason or above the value of CW[AC shall be updated as follows before invoking the backoff procedure for each AC omitting AC for BS bsmax CW cwmin and cwmax if BS is less than bsmax BS

qualcomm zhou lan broadcom abstract proposed language to address the issue of disallowed subchannels NOTE that as of r7 this document includes the material that had been present in 11-18-1258r0 the proposed change is to add new field to the end of the HE operation IE called operational subchannel information field one additional bit called punctured operation is added inside of the HE operation information field to signal the presence/absence of the new field the new field is combination of length and bit map where the length is bit value and the bit map is the length of octets indicated in the length field each bit of the bitmap corresponds to subchannel of resolution 242-tones the lowest numbered bit corresponds to the subchannel with the lowest frequency of the BSS operating channel etc bit set to indicates transmissions are allowed on that subchannel bit set to indicates transmission is not allowed on that subchannel the absence of the field indicates no puncturing transmission is allowed on all subchannels of the BSS channel width corresponding behavioral language is added to subclause 27 change to the HE NDP announcement is included to signal the puncturing of the sounding sequence by adding disallowed subchannel bitmap field which is present when the AID11 value is 2047 and the disambiguation subfield value is instead of normal STA info field also included are proposed HE MIMO control field changes to indicate punctured set of feedback information basically adding the same disallowed subchannels bitmap to the HE MIMO control field the proposed changes on this document are based on tgax draft REVISION NOTES R0 initial R1 removed resolution field updated document revision number references R2 the supported channel width indicated in the HT and VHT capabilities elements is not the same as the value represented in the HE capabilities element when some subchannels are disallowed R3 added modified STA info subfield in the 20 VHT/HE NDP announcement frame format subclause to carry subchannel punctured information using newly reserved AID11 value added punctured operation behavioural description within 27 sounding sequences and support where the bandwidth of the HE feedback is determined first by applying the tone index values and then by applying the disallowed subchannel indication within the HE NDP announcement frame similar language added to 27 rules for HE sounding protocol sequences where the bandwidth of the HE NDP announcement frame is determined change resolution of operational subchannel information in the HE op IE from 20 mhz to 242-tone added disallowed subchannel bitmap subfield to the HE MIMO control field in 62 and some behavioural language to 27 and 27 to describe its use changed MIB variable name shortened it R4 add rule that when STA info field in the HE NDPA frame has the AID11 field value of 2047 then that STA info field shall be the first in the frame in 62 HE MIMO control field changes modified the disallowed subchannel bitmap length to be or and add reserved field of or the intent was to add 16 bits to allow word alignment of the remainder of the frame contents and the disallowed subchannel bitmap is only bits in length not 16 so reserved field is needed to reach total of 16 bits R5 update text to D3 update CID remove LB230 CID replace with LB233 CID add disambiguation field to STA info subfield of HE NDPA frame when AID11 2047 27 redefined MU sounding vs SU sounding based on number of STA info fields present in the NDPA frame now excluding AID11==2047 from the count 27 16 BSS BW indication and interpretation added sentences to describe how puncturing capable AP sets BW and bitmap values BW set to the set of contiguous subchannels indicated in the operational subchannel bitmap that includes the primary channel and how non-AP STA combines the two fields to determine the actual available punctured set of subchannels/tones for transmission R6 change the punctured sounding allowance to reference SU txbfer/ee instead of MU make the condition for modified STA info field in NDPA as AID11==2047 and disambiguation 27 16 slight modification to the wording because the VHT cap is not indicating support for 80+80 or 160 mhz operation but the STA wants to support that mode so cannot say that it indicated support because it did not indicate it R7 MERGED with 11-18-1258 brought that material into this doc definitions 802 11 added subchannel punctured PPDU abbreviations and acronyms added SCP subchannel punctured 63 HE compressed BF report field note that avgsnri does not include punctured tone information 238 HE operation element modified the definition of the operational subchannel information field specifically changing terms to make the meaning more generic and leaving the specific definition of subchannel to the behavioural subclauses 10 channel width selection for control frames added this subclause reference to make changes surrounding punctured exchanges and the effect on control responses 27 slight modification to wording to make it clearer 27 11 new subclause for setting the ACTIVE_SUBCHANNELS parameter needed to cover the non-SCP PPDU case refers to 27 16 6a for the SCP PPDU case 27 16 HT VHT HE capabilities and operation elements text changed one instance of HT capabilities to HT operation 27 16 HT VHT HE capabilities and operation elements text changed conditions to be more accurate added text for setting the VHT operation IE 27 16 channelization determination protocol for HE SCP STA added 27 16 deleted an occurrence of HE capabilities element channel width set subfield that should have referred to the VHT operation element’s channel width subfield because this sentence was redundant to the requirements specified earlier in the subclause for setting the VHT op IE channel width subfield 27 16 deleted portion of sentence allowing HE SCP STA to transmit on any subchannel in the allowed bitmap because this was made redundant by the addition of the dot11CurrentChannelWidth for HE SCP STA determination language 27 16 6a subchannel punctured operation new subclause that describes behaviour for AP and STA that are HE SCP STA and that provides requirements for setting various TXVECTOR parameters for SCP PPDU transmissions including correspondence between values of ACTIVE_SUBCHANNELS and FORMAT and CH_BANDWIDTH includes settings for NDP and HE_MU and NON_HT_DUP cases mesh STA prohibited 28 optional feature lists added subchannel punctured operation 28 add ACTIVE_SUBCHANNELS to TXVECTOR RXVECTOR parameter table taken from 11-18-1258 and modified to define the width of subchannel represented by the bitmap depending on format and modified to account for comments from robert 28 13 non-HT duplicate transmission define the PHY implications of puncturing of non-HT duplicates based on the ACTIVE_SUBCHANNELS parameter 10 added few text changes to point to 27 16 6a for control response frames that are SCP PPDU for setting of TXVECTOR parameters updated author list R8 added more CID tags to proposed changes updated document reference R9 throughout document removed most instances of “or the disambiguation subfield is equal to 0” 20 HE NDPA brought table for bitmap encoding from operational subchannel bitmap to this subclause to unify the encoding of all such bitmaps now it encodes 20 mhz subchannels that are disallowed and includes language for determining which 242-tone rus are disallowed 63 HE comp BF rpt field added language to indicate that FB information for tones disallowed by the bitmap is not included in the field also added text to indicate that the average SNR value is computed on allowed tones only 64 HE MU exclusive BF rpt field added language to indicate that FB information for tones disallowed by the bitmap is not included in the field also added text to indicate that the average SNR value is computed on allowed tones only 65 HE cqi-only rpt field added language to indicate that FB information for tones disallowed by the bitmap is not included in the field no need for average SNR statement because it does not apply in this case 238 HE operation element slight modification to the encoding table of the bitmap and text above it to indicate that the bit in the bitmap corresponding to the primary 20 mhz subchannel is always set to also moved the table from this subclause into 20 for HE NDPA since the same encoding is used there add SCP center channel freq seg and because cannot reuse existing CCFS1 and CCFS2 values because they are indicated as in many cases when SCP needs non-zero value 27 16 6a subchannel punctured operation subclause fixed problem of inverted bit sense between disallowed subchannel bitmap subfield and ACTIVE_SUBCHANNELS parameters modified table entry slightly to remove redundant information on all zeros case removed allowance of non-AP STA to transmit an SCP PPDU that has FORMAT HE_MU updated document reference R10 add CID

in D3 is lacking several features needed to make it useful especially in radar channels when some subchannels are blocked for very long durations please consider adding the following enhancements broadcast message to declare subchannel punctureds punctured NDP to enable BF and DL MU-MIMO NDPA signaling of punctured subbands in the NDP punctured non-ht dup to carry NDPA new PHY modes to enable single user transmission across the entire available punctured BW with at least 60MHz support and one mode for 80MHz 120MHz revise tgax editor to make changes as shown in 11-18/0496r10 that are marked with CID 16723 15920 lochan verma 28 16 547 22 enable sounding in transmissions where certain channels are punctured as in comment revise tgax editor to make changes as shown in 11-18/0496r10 that are marked with CID 16723 which are redundant to changes for CID 15920 discussion operation within some bands in some regulatory jurisdictions requires monitoring and/or other means of determining whether primary operator is using channels in the band database information if primary devices are detected or otherwise indicated as operating within channel then regulations might require that secondary users WLAN devices are required to cease transmissions in the channel because some regulations allow operation on an aggregation of multiple disjoint channels in some of these “shared” bands and might add additional similar regulations for various bands in the future and provided that it is in the interest of 802 11 devices to be able to take advantage of disjoint aggregation then it is necessary to include signalling for 802 11 devices to communicate which disjoint channel combinations are allowed to be used at any given time within various existing regulations the concept exists wherein device operating as non-primary user in the band may be master device which determines which channels are available and which are not available and through some means communicates this information often implicitly to non-master devices aka dependent devices existing 802 11 tgax signalling to support the master device concept is both implicit and positive and therefore does not adequately address the case of discontiguous channel aggregation for example master device acting as an AP might determine that primary user has begun operating in channel that is currently being used by the master device and the master device may then choose to inform any non-master device of its intent to change to new channel without explicitly indicating the reason for doing so the channel switch announcement element can be used non-master devices wishing to operate on specific channel must first identify the presence of master device operating on the channel and the presence of such master device transmitting on the channel is an implicit indication of the availability of the channel for use by the non-primary user that is the presence or absence of master device transmission on channel is an implicit indication of the availability of the channel for use by non-primary devices this is implicit signalling as there is no specific field in for example beacon that indicates that the channel is available for use for discontiguous operation master device could operate on an aggregation of channels while intentionally avoiding transmissions on an interior channel based on its knowledge of primary user use of that interior channel non-master device currently has no way to determine whether some portion of an aggregated set of channels is not actually available for use by non-primary devices for example an 802 11 tgax AP could indicate operation on an 80 mhz channel as non-primary user but then discover that primary user is operating on one of the 20 mhz channels within the 80 mhz the AP can avoid transmitting on the protected sub-channel but there is no signalling to indicate to other devices non-AP stas that that sub-channel is not available the text in this document offers proposal for communicating this explicit information summary of the proposed change the proposed change is to add new field to the end of the HE operation IE called operational subchannel information field one additional bit called punctured operation is added inside of the HE operation information field to signal the presence/absence of the new field the new field is combination of length and bit map where the length is bit value and the bit map is the length of octets indicated in the length field each bit of the bitmap corresponds to specific subchannel the lowest numbered bit corresponds to the subchannel with the lowest frequency of the BSS operating channel etc note that length field is needed in order to maintain extensibility of the HE operation element bit set to indicates transmissions are allowed on that subchannel bit set to indicates transmission is not allowed on that subchannel the absence of the field indicates no puncturing transmission is allowed on all subchannels of the BSS channel width corresponding behavioral language is added to subclause 27 one might argue for changes to the equation describing the construction of an HE PPDU the per-tone equation similarly one might argue for changes to the 40 mhz non-HT DUP equation 19-61 to account for missing subchannels see the term at the front which is the scaling factor and the summation that spans to n20mhz the equation would need to mention TXVECTOR parameter ACTIVE_SUBCHANNELS and for 80 mhz non-HT DUP similar changes for equation 21-100 note that the

qualcomm zhou lan broadcom abstract proposed language to address the issue of disallowed subchannels NOTE that as of r7 this document includes the material that had been present in 11-18-1258r0 the proposed change is to add new field to the end of the HE operation IE called operational subchannel information field one additional bit called punctured operation is added inside of the HE operation information field to signal the presence/absence of the new field the new field is combination of length and bit map where the length is bit value and the bit map is the length of octets indicated in the length field each bit of the bitmap corresponds to subchannel of resolution 242-tones the lowest numbered bit corresponds to the subchannel with the lowest frequency of the BSS operating channel etc bit set to indicates transmissions are allowed on that subchannel bit set to indicates transmission is not allowed on that subchannel the absence of the field indicates no puncturing transmission is allowed on all subchannels of the BSS channel width corresponding behavioral language is added to subclause 27 change to the HE NDP announcement is included to signal the puncturing of the sounding sequence by adding disallowed subchannel bitmap field which is present when the AID11 value is 2047 and the disambiguation subfield value is instead of normal STA info field also included are proposed HE MIMO control field changes to indicate punctured set of feedback information basically adding the same disallowed subchannels bitmap to the HE MIMO control field the proposed changes on this document are based on tgax draft REVISION NOTES R0 initial R1 removed resolution field updated document revision number references R2 the supported channel width indicated in the HT and VHT capabilities elements is not the same as the value represented in the HE capabilities element when some subchannels are disallowed R3 added modified STA info subfield in the 20 VHT/HE NDP announcement frame format subclause to carry subchannel punctured information using newly reserved AID11 value added punctured operation behavioural description within 27 sounding sequences and support where the bandwidth of the HE feedback is determined first by applying the tone index values and then by applying the disallowed subchannel indication within the HE NDP announcement frame similar language added to 27 rules for HE sounding protocol sequences where the bandwidth of the HE NDP announcement frame is determined change resolution of operational subchannel information in the HE op IE from 20 mhz to 242-tone added disallowed subchannel bitmap subfield to the HE MIMO control field in 62 and some behavioural language to 27 and 27 to describe its use changed MIB variable name shortened it R4 add rule that when STA info field in the HE NDPA frame has the AID11 field value of 2047 then that STA info field shall be the first in the frame in 62 HE MIMO control field changes modified the disallowed subchannel bitmap length to be or and add reserved field of or the intent was to add 16 bits to allow word alignment of the remainder of the frame contents and the disallowed subchannel bitmap is only bits in length not 16 so reserved field is needed to reach total of 16 bits R5 update text to D3 update CID remove LB230 CID replace with LB233 CID add disambiguation field to STA info subfield of HE NDPA frame when AID11 2047 27 redefined MU sounding vs SU sounding based on number of STA info fields present in the NDPA frame now excluding AID11==2047 from the count 27 16 BSS BW indication and interpretation added sentences to describe how puncturing capable AP sets BW and bitmap values BW set to the set of contiguous subchannels indicated in the operational subchannel bitmap that includes the primary channel and how non-AP STA combines the two fields to determine the actual available punctured set of subchannels/tones for transmission R6 change the punctured sounding allowance to reference SU txbfer/ee instead of MU make the condition for modified STA info field in NDPA as AID11==2047 and disambiguation 27 16 slight modification to the wording because the VHT cap is not indicating support for 80+80 or 160 mhz operation but the STA wants to support that mode so cannot say that it indicated support because it did not indicate it R7 MERGED with 11-18-1258 brought that material into this doc definitions 802 11 added subchannel punctured PPDU abbreviations and acronyms added SCP subchannel punctured 63 HE compressed BF report field note that avgsnri does not include punctured tone information 238 HE operation element modified the definition of the operational subchannel information field specifically changing terms to make the meaning more generic and leaving the specific definition of subchannel to the behavioural subclauses 10 channel width selection for control frames added this subclause reference to make changes surrounding punctured exchanges and the effect on control responses 27 slight modification to wording to make it clearer 27 11 new subclause for setting the ACTIVE_SUBCHANNELS parameter needed to cover the non-SCP PPDU case refers to 27 16 6a for the SCP PPDU case 27 16 HT VHT HE capabilities and operation elements text changed one instance of HT capabilities to HT operation 27 16 HT VHT HE capabilities and operation elements text changed conditions to be more accurate added text for setting the VHT operation IE 27 16 channelization determination protocol for HE SCP STA added 27 16 deleted an occurrence of HE capabilities element channel width set subfield that should have referred to the VHT operation element’s channel width subfield because this sentence was redundant to the requirements specified earlier in the subclause for setting the VHT op IE channel width subfield 27 16 deleted portion of sentence allowing HE SCP STA to transmit on any subchannel in the allowed bitmap because this was made redundant by the addition of the dot11CurrentChannelWidth for HE SCP STA determination language 27 16 6a subchannel punctured operation new subclause that describes behaviour for AP and STA that are HE SCP STA and that provides requirements for setting various TXVECTOR parameters for SCP PPDU transmissions including correspondence between values of ACTIVE_SUBCHANNELS and FORMAT and CH_BANDWIDTH includes settings for NDP and HE_MU and NON_HT_DUP cases mesh STA prohibited 28 optional feature lists added subchannel punctured operation 28 add ACTIVE_SUBCHANNELS to TXVECTOR RXVECTOR parameter table taken from 11-18-1258 and modified to define the width of subchannel represented by the bitmap depending on format and modified to account for comments from robert 28 13 non-HT duplicate transmission define the PHY implications of puncturing of non-HT duplicates based on the ACTIVE_SUBCHANNELS parameter 10 added few text changes to point to 27 16 6a for control response frames that are SCP PPDU for setting of TXVECTOR parameters updated author list R8 added more CID tags to proposed changes updated document reference R9 throughout document removed most instances of “or the disambiguation subfield is equal to 0” 20 HE NDPA brought table for bitmap encoding from operational subchannel bitmap to this subclause to unify the encoding of all such bitmaps now it encodes 20 mhz subchannels that are disallowed and includes language for determining which 242-tone rus are disallowed 63 HE comp BF rpt field added language to indicate that FB information for tones disallowed by the bitmap is not included in the field also added text to indicate that the average SNR value is computed on allowed tones only 64 HE MU exclusive BF rpt field added language to indicate that FB information for tones disallowed by the bitmap is not included in the field also added text to indicate that the average SNR value is computed on allowed tones only 65 HE cqi-only rpt field added language to indicate that FB information for tones disallowed by the bitmap is not included in the field no need for average SNR statement because it does not apply in this case 238 HE operation element slight modification to the encoding table of the bitmap and text above it to indicate that the bit in the bitmap corresponding to the primary 20 mhz subchannel is always set to also moved the table from this subclause into 20 for HE NDPA since the same encoding is used there add SCP center channel freq seg and because cannot reuse existing CCFS1 and CCFS2 values because they are indicated as in many cases when SCP needs non-zero value 27 16 6a subchannel punctured operation subclause fixed problem of inverted bit sense between disallowed subchannel bitmap subfield and ACTIVE_SUBCHANNELS parameters modified table entry slightly to remove redundant information on all zeros case removed allowance of non-AP STA to transmit an SCP PPDU that has FORMAT HE_MU updated document reference END OF REVISION

make it useful especially in radar channels when some subchannels are blocked for very long durations please consider adding the following enhancements broadcast message to declare subchannel punctureds punctured NDP to enable BF and DL MU-MIMO NDPA signaling of punctured subbands in the NDP punctured non-ht dup to carry NDPA new PHY modes to enable single user transmission across the entire available punctured BW with at least 60MHz support and one mode for 80MHz 120MHz revise tgax editor to make changes as shown in 11-18/0496r9 that are marked with CID 16723 discussion operation within some bands in some regulatory jurisdictions requires monitoring and/or other means of determining whether primary operator is using channels in the band database information if primary devices are detected or otherwise indicated as operating within channel then regulations might require that secondary users WLAN devices are required to cease transmissions in the channel because some regulations allow operation on an aggregation of multiple disjoint channels in some of these “shared” bands and might add additional similar regulations for various bands in the future and provided that it is in the interest of 802 11 devices to be able to take advantage of disjoint aggregation then it is necessary to include signalling for 802 11 devices to communicate which disjoint channel combinations are allowed to be used at any given time within various existing regulations the concept exists wherein device operating as non-primary user in the band may be master device which determines which channels are available and which are not available and through some means communicates this information often implicitly to non-master devices aka dependent devices existing 802 11 tgax signalling to support the master device concept is both implicit and positive and therefore does not adequately address the case of discontiguous channel aggregation for example master device acting as an AP might determine that primary user has begun operating in channel that is currently being used by the master device and the master device may then choose to inform any non-master device of its intent to change to new channel without explicitly indicating the reason for doing so the channel switch announcement element can be used non-master devices wishing to operate on specific channel must first identify the presence of master device operating on the channel and the presence of such master device transmitting on the channel is an implicit indication of the availability of the channel for use by the non-primary user that is the presence or absence of master device transmission on channel is an implicit indication of the availability of the channel for use by non-primary devices this is implicit signalling as there is no specific field in for example beacon that indicates that the channel is available for use for discontiguous operation master device could operate on an aggregation of channels while intentionally avoiding transmissions on an interior channel based on its knowledge of primary user use of that interior channel non-master device currently has no way to determine whether some portion of an aggregated set of channels is not actually available for use by non-primary devices for example an 802 11 tgax AP could indicate operation on an 80 mhz channel as non-primary user but then discover that primary user is operating on one of the 20 mhz channels within the 80 mhz the AP can avoid transmitting on the protected sub-channel but there is no signalling to indicate to other devices non-AP stas that that sub-channel is not available the text in this document offers proposal for communicating this explicit information summary of the proposed change the proposed change is to add new field to the end of the HE operation IE called operational subchannel information field one additional bit called punctured operation is added inside of the HE operation information field to signal the presence/absence of the new field the new field is combination of length and bit map where the length is bit value and the bit map is the length of octets indicated in the length field each bit of the bitmap corresponds to specific subchannel the lowest numbered bit corresponds to the subchannel with the lowest frequency of the BSS operating channel etc note that length field is needed in order to maintain extensibility of the HE operation element bit set to indicates transmissions are allowed on that subchannel bit set to indicates transmission is not allowed on that subchannel the absence of the field indicates no puncturing transmission is allowed on all subchannels of the BSS channel width corresponding behavioral language is added to subclause 27 one might argue for changes to the equation describing the construction of an HE PPDU the per-tone equation similarly one might argue for changes to the 40 mhz non-HT DUP equation 19-61 to account for missing subchannels see the term at the front which is the scaling factor and the summation that spans to n20mhz the equation would need to mention TXVECTOR parameter ACTIVE_SUBCHANNELS and for 80 mhz non-HT DUP similar changes for equation 21-100 note that the proposed language here takes different approach see modified clause 28 subclauses proposed changes to draft text of tgax D3

contains introduction of background information and network requirements of real-time mobile game under wi-fi table of contents terminology characteristics of real-time mobile game packet traffic model problem observed lagging analysis quadrant of jitter and latency between STA and AP root cause for lagging network requirements analysis from client to AP 10 terminology real-time mobile game the mobile game can connect multiple players together in single game session and transfer data messages between game server and connected players real-time means the feedback should present on screen as users operate in game for good game experience the latency from client to game servers plus game servers processing time should not be noticed by users as they play gateway connect WLAN to WAN internet usually this entity refers to wi-fi router lagging in game lag is noticeable delay between the action of players and the reaction of the server in game usually high latency cause lagging and lagging can be reflected as picture freeze or “fast-forward” or frame skipping in game in-game latency round trip time between client and game server in datacenter real-time mobile game has low threshold usually users would not encounter lagging due to network when the value is less than 100ms jitter jitter reflects the fluctuation of latency over time it can be evaluated by the time difference between two adjacent in-game ping values in real-time mobile game the jitter is calculated as standard deviation during period time disconnect when latency is too high even causes packet loss client will disconnect from game servers after several times of retry connection characteristics of real-time mobile game packet packet size small packet with size of 100-500 bytes uplink and downlink usually downlink packets are bigger than uplink packet flow rate average every 30-60ms one packet uplink and downlink usually downlink packet interval is larger than uplink bandwidth between client and AP 5-1Mbps game data usually the uplink packets carry users’ instructions while downlink packets carry calculation results or calculation instructions so both uplink and downlink packets are important and should be delivered as soon as possible protocol mostly UDP traffic model there are two popular mechanisms of synchronization between client and game server in real-time mobile games one is frame lockstep sync the other one is status sync there are three stages took into consideration in the analysis initial stage selected users are in same battle room and ready to start gaming game map is yet to present to users gaming stage users can operate in game ending stage game over and present game results traffic model for status sync real-time mobile game component distribution

DL PDF for frame sync UL problem observed users connect to game under various environment such as home restaurants subway malls etc around 60 users connect to game via wi-fi with 20-30 possibilities that users encounter lagging in-game 60-70 lagging because of problems between client and gateway around 10-15 are remain unknown which pending validate process test plan to locate problem comparison of lagging rate between 4G and wi-fi based on big data is as following table mode chance of lagging wi-fi 23 4G 15 below is lagging analysis per 4GHz and 5GHz wi-fi based on data from over 100 million pvp player vs player games band no lagging lagging 4G 74 59 25 41 5G 86 87 13 13 lagging analysis real-time mobile game request instant feedback of in-game operation from multiple players who are in the same battle room lagging will cause picture not fluent and impact user experience negatively moreover the time difference that user get the response will cause unfairness because the response is not synchronous common observation is during period time although average latency is low worst case latency spike can be several times higher than the average jitter will cause spike in latency when latency is too high which exceeds threshold and then cause packet loss lagging is expected the relationship between game experience and latency is as below table based on big data the average latency from client to AP is 7ms however user experience needs to be considered over the complete path from client to game server the latency breakdown from client to game server is as below quadrant of jitter and latency between STA and AP description of the quadrant latency is from STA to AP RTT jitter is standard deviation of latency quadrant network status between STA and AP is good this is best scenario quadrant network status between STA and AP barely impact the game experience quadrant network status between STA and AP impact game experience quadrant network status between STA and AP impact game experience negatively game experience of point and shall be enhanced by the trade-off of latency and jitter root cause for lagging high latency till packet loss and disconnection high latency itself will cause picture not fluent and users would feel they can hardly control the in-game character low average latency but severe ping spikes random high ping spikes can cause packet delay/loss which will instantly affect user experience so to summarize the average latency is important since it is fundamental to realize the real-time manner and provide immersive game experience but the worst-case latency is the key problem and should be improved and controlled when average latency can be controlled in one certain range the tradeoff between stability and latency is one direction that worth exploring network requirements analysis from client to AP specifications from client to AP in below table based on experience value specification value latency 10ms packet loss jitter 5ms high latency packet(>30ms to control worst case spike the average latency can go up to 30ms for stability reference PDF https://en wikipedia org/wiki/Probability_density_function extreme
